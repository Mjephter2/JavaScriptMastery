<!-- Some types of events have the potential to fire rapidly, many times in a row (the "mousemove" and "scroll" 
events, for example). When handling such events, you must be careful not to do anything too time-consuming 
or your handler will take up so much time that interaction with the document starts to feel slow.
If you do need to do something nontrivial in such a handler, you can use setTimeout to make sure you are not 
doing it too often. This is usually called debouncing the event. There are several slightly different 
approaches to this. -->
