Status codes starting with a 2 indicate that the request succeeded. 
Codes starting with 4 mean there was something wrong with the request. 
404 is probably the most famous HTTP status codeâ€”it means that the 
resource could not be found. Codes that start with 5 mean an error 
happened on the server and the request is not to blame.
