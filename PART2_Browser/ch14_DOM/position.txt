The position style property influences layout in a powerful way. By default it has a value of static, 
meaning the element sits in its normal place in the document. When it is set to relative, the element 
still takes up space in the document, but now the top and left style properties can be used to move it 
relative to that normal place. When position is set to absolute, the element is removed from the normal 
document flowâ€”that is, it no longer takes up space and may overlap with other elements. Also, its top 
and left properties can be used to absolutely position it relative to the top-left corner of the nearest 
enclosing element whose position property isn't static, or relative to the document if no such enclosing 
element exists.
