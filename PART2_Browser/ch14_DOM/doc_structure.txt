Think of an HTML document as a nested set of boxes. Tags enclose other tags, which in turn contain other tags 
or text. The data structure the browser uses to represent the document follows this shape. For each box, there 
is an object, which we can interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents and which boxes 
and text it contains. This representation is called the Document Object Model, or DOM for short.
The global binding document gives us access to these objects. Its documentElement property refers to the object 
representing the <html> tag. Since every HTML 'document' has a head and a body, it also has head and body properties, 
pointing at those elements.
Each DOM node object has a nodeType property, which contains a code (number) that identifies the type of node. 
Elements have code 1, which is also defined as the constant property Node.ELEMENT_NODE. Text nodes, representing 
a section of text in the document, get code 3 (Node.TEXT_NODE). Comments have code 8 (Node.COMMENT_NODE).
