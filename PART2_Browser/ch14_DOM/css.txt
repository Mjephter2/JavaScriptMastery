The styling system for HTML is called CSS, for Cascading Style Sheets. 
A style sheet is a set of rules for how to style elements in a document. 
 It can be given inside a <style> tag.
 The cascading in the name refers to the fact that multiple such rules 
 are combined to produce the final style for an element.
 A rule for .abc applies to all elements with "abc" in their class attribute. 
 A rule for '#xyz' applies to the element with an id attribute of "xyz" 
 (which should be unique within the document).
