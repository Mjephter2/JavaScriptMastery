The World Wide Web (not to be confused with the Internet as a whole) is a set of protocols and formats that 
allow us to visit web pages in a browser. The “Web” part in the name refers to the fact that such pages can 
easily link to each other, thus connecting into a huge mesh that users can move through.
To become part of the Web, all you need to do is connect a machine to the Internet and have it listen on port 
80 with the HTTP protocol so that other computers can ask it for documents.
Machines connected to the Internet get an IP address, which is a number that can be used to send messages to 
that machine, and looks something like 149.210.142.219 or 2001:4860:4860::8888. But lists of more or less 
random numbers are hard to remember and awkward to type, so you can instead register a domain name for a 
specific address or set of addresses.
