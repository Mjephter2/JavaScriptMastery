network protocol
a style of communication over a network. There are protocols for sending emails, for
fetching emails, for sharing files and even for controlling computers

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
protocol for retrieving named resources (information such as web pages or pictures)

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
It is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite. 
It originated in the initial network implementation in which it complemented the Internet Protocol (IP). 
Therefore, the entire suite is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. TCP provides reliable, ordered, 
and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating 
via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the World Wide Web, email, remote administration, 
and file transfer rely on TCP, which is part of the Transport Layer of the TCP/IP suite. SSL/TLS often 
runs on top of TCP. (Ref Wikipedia)
A TCP connection works as follows: one computer must be waiting, or listening, for other computers to start 
talking to it. To be able to listen for different kinds of communication at the same time on a single machine, 
each listener has a number (called a port) associated with it. Most protocols specify which port should be 
used by default. (Ref. 'Eloquent Javascript' by Marijn Haverbeke 3rd Edition page 220)
