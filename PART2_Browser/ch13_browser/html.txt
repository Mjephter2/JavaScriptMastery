HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the document format used for web pages. 
An HTML document contains text, as well as tags that give structure to the text, describing things such as 
links, paragraphs, and headings.
The <script> tag allows us to include Javascript code in a document.
Including large programs directly in HTML documents is often impractical. The <script> tag can be given an 
src attribute to fetch a script file (a text file containing a JavaScript program) from a URL.
