// If you run this script on your own machine, you can point your web browser at http://localhost:8000/hello 
// to make a request to your server. It will respond with a small HTML page.
// Making requests with Nodeâ€™s raw functionality is rather verbose. There are much more convenient wrapper packages 
// available on NPM. For example, node-fetch provides the promise-based fetch interface that we know from the browser.
