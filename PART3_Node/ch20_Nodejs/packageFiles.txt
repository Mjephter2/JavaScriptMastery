It is recommended to create a package.json file for each project, either manually or by running npm init. 
It contains some information about the project, such as its name and version, and lists its dependencies.
A packahe.json file look like this
{
    "author": "Author Name",
    "name": "project name",
    "description": "project description",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "main": "run.js",
    "dependencies": {
      "dijkstrajs": "^1.0.1",
      "random-item": "^1.0.0"
    },
    "license": "ISC"
  }
When you run npm install without naming a package to install, NPM will install the dependencies listed in 
package.json. When you install a specific package that is not already listed as a dependency, NPM will add 
it to package.json.

Versions ( page 357-358 )
A package.json file lists both the program's own version and versions for its dependencies. Versions are a 
way to deal with the fact that packages evolve separately, and code written to work with a package as it 
existed at one point may not work with a later, modified version of the package.
A caret character (^) in front of the version number for a dependency in package.json indicates that any 
version compatible with the given number may be installed. So, for example, "^2.3.0" would mean that any 
version greater than or equal to 2.3.0 and less than 3.0.0 is allowed.
