The repetition operators {+, *, ?, {}} are called greedy, meaning they match as much as they
and backtrack from there. By placing a question mark before them {+?, *?, ??, {}?}, they become 
ungreedy and start by matching as little as possible, matching more only when the remaining pattern
does not fit the smaller match.
