encapsulation
The core idea in object-oriented programming is to divide programs into smaller pieces
make each piece responsible for managing its own state. This way, some knowledge about
the way piece of the program works can be kept to that piece. Someone working on the 
rest of the program does not have to remember  or even be aware of that knowledge. When
ever these local details change, only the code directly around it needs to be updated.

interfaces
limited sets of functions or bindings that provide useful functionality at a more
abstract level, hiding their precise implementation

prototypes
another object that is used as a fallback source of properties
